# Operating Mechanism and Process
The entire mechanism relies on scheduled tasks provided by  `GitHub Actions` , executed every  `60 minutes` . The overall process is as follows:
1. Get application information for paid rankings
2. Update tracked app list
3. Get the latest price information for apps
   1. Get app details and the price of  `App`  through  [iTunes Search API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1) 
   2. Based on the app details link obtained in the previous step, parse the link to get the price of  `In-App Purchases` 
4. Read stored price information
5. Calculate discount information
6. Store the latest price information
7. Update  `RSS`  files
8. Push notification to  `Telegram` 
9. Push notification to  `DingTalk` 
10. Update  `README.md` 
11. Submit  `Git`  update

After the above process, if there is discount information, friends who subscribed to  `RSS Source`  and  `Telegram Channel`  will receive a push notification
