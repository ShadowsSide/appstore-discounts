  Have you ever struggled to find confidence on stage or inspiration in the studio? AeroPads cues immersive pads and soundscapes that inspire and equip you to perform and write your best.

ENHANCE YOUR SOUND. ENGAGE YOUR AUDIENCE.
Every musician has experienced an empty mix or an awkward transition. When using AeroPads, you instantly add more dimension and character to your sound. With a more immersive mix and the ability to perform smooth and seamless transitions, you will feel more confident while your audience will be more engaged.

FOR EVERY MUSICIAN.
Pads and soundscapes are a versatile accompaniment to nearly any style of music. Whether you are a soloist or full band, AeroPads will take your sound to the next level. Rock bands, worship teams, wedding singers, producers, songwriters, and instrumentalists are just a few of the many types of musicians that have loved using AeroPads.

DESIGNED FOR THE STAGE. INSPIRED BY SPACE.
AeroPads features creative and immersive soundscapes paired with a beautiful and intuitive interface, all inspired by the pinnacle of exploration and inspiration: outer space.

CREATIVITY THAT SPARKS CREATIVITY.
AeroPads aren't your typical pads. Most pads out there are really boring or insanely obnoxious. However, AeroPads features thoughtfully crafted soundscapes that are meticulously fine-tuned with the perfect amount of harmonic and textural movement. Simply put, AeroPads won't step on the toes of your arrangement or get on the nerves of your sound guy (like most other pads out there).


Highlighted Features:
- A beautiful space-inspired interface with a simple and intuitive design.
- Live View: Every key and three of your favorite patches are instantly accessible (best suited for experimentation, free-flowing sets, and songwriting).
- Setlist View: Plan and build a detailed setlist (best suited for structured sets and seamless transitions).
- The iconic Atmosphere Soundpack which includes five unique patches named after and inspired by the layers of Earth's atmosphere. 
- Three patches can be added to Live View to be made instantly accessible, so there's no need to dig through menus to just to change a patch when performing live.
- Additional patches and Soundpacks available for purchase.
- Key-specific pads in multiple tonalities: major, minor, and neutral.
- Concert pitch adjustment.


How to Use:
01. Cue a pad that matches the key of your musical arrangement.
02. Play overtop of the accompanying pads and soundcapes.
03. Enjoy the boost of audience engagement, musician confidence, and creative inspiration.

Pads and soundscapes are intended as a subtle accompaniment to musical arrangements/performances. They are designed to be cued according to the key of the arrangement. Once cued, you'll hear a droning pad centered around the root note with additional harmonic textures within the selected key. The only time a pad's key should change within a song is in the instance of a key change. For best results, mix AeroPads appropriately within the overall mix. When mixed too loud, AeroPads may compete with melodies and the arrangement. When mixed too quietly, AeroPads may be less effective. When mixed appropriately, they will sound awesome.

  Play local music or stream from a file/media server with LMP. 

Apple TV version included, with support for Emby, Navidrome, Plex, and Jellyfin.

‚ñ£ Import via iTunes or folder and play local tracks

LMP was designed from scratch with offline music in mind. You can store music on your device in two forms: iTunes music or audio file. The first would require syncing with iTunes on Windows or Finder on Mac. To import as audio files, simply transfer them to the LMP Music folder on your device via any means. If you choose the latter, you will be able to enjoy additional features, such as editing of metadata via the LMP browser assistant.

‚ñ£ Connect to a cloud server and stream music from the server

If you have insufficient storage on your device, you can also store your tracks on a server and stream from the server. File servers using SMB and WebDAV are supported. However, we recommend hosting a media server instead, via Plex, Emby, Navidrome or Subsonic due to faster import speeds. All tracks come together seamlessly, no matter how they are imported, providing a unified experience. You can enable the option in the settings to hide repeated tracks across servers.

‚ñ£ Manage playlists with ease

LMP has its own playlist system that allows you to not only add tracks from all sources, but also artists. All tracks belonging to the artist would automatically be added to the playlist everytime you open the app or rescan, even newly added ones. With flexible artist splitting, you will be able to ensure that tracks get allocated to the right artist.

When the AI playlist is enabled, LMP will also be able to generate a playlist for you based on your listening preferences. Usage data is only recorded if this feature is enabled, and all data recorded for this is stored locally, so you do not have to worry about data privacy.

‚ñ£ Supports CarPlay & Siri

With support for CarPlay, you can start playing a playlist or control what's playing from your car's CarPlay console. Alternatively, you can also tell Siri to start playing a track or all tracks belonging to a particular artist, or use it to control the playback state of the current track.

‚ñ£ Support LRC lyrics

LMP supports both embedded lyrics and .lrc files. Use the LRC or Enhanced LRC format, and the app will be able to autoscroll lyrics as the music plays. If you do not have time to add your own lyrics, you can specify the lyrics API to use, and the app will attempt to fetch lyrics of any track that is playing.

  "If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you." - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK

"This War of Mine isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúfun,‚Äù but it‚Äôs definitely a game worth playing." , 9/10, 148apps

"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad" , Game Informer

In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. 

The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. 

Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.

This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition
It's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same ‚Äì how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? 

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Inspired by real-life events 
‚Ä¢ Control your survivors and manage your shelter 
‚Ä¢ Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves ‚Äì anything that helps you survive 
‚Ä¢ Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience 
‚Ä¢ Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game 
‚Ä¢ Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme

This War of Mine experience is now broadened with "The Little Ones" expansion. "The Little Ones" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective‚Äïthat of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.

‚Ä¢ Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine
‚Ä¢ Protect innocent children
‚Ä¢ Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need
‚Ä¢ Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children

PLEASE NOTE: This game is optimized for latest devices. While playing on older devices such as iPhone 4s or iPad 2 you might experience lower frame rates.

  AudioTools from Studio Six Digital is a suite of professional-grade audio and acoustic analysis apps. Included in the price of this app is a great collection of professional tools -- SPL, RTA, FFT, Speaker Polarity Test, Generator, Audio Scope, CLF Viewer, and Recorder, and the framework to add more powerful modules as you need them.

Customize AudioTools for your needs by buying any of the additional optional modules, like Smaart Tools I, SPL Graph, or Impulse Response, at any time right from your iOS device.

We test every iOS device and calibrate the microphone level and frequency response for the best results. We have the ability to turn off the Apple low frequency filters, and on many devices we can measure up to 120 dB SPL.

Add iTestMic, iPrecisionMic, or iAudioInterface2 for a complete professional audio and acoustic test and measurement platform.

  Deflection is a powerful, versatile calculator for beams, 2D trusses, and 2D frames.  The interface is simple and intuitive, and the graphical output is state-of-the-art.  In addition to reaction, shear, bending moment, and deflection results, Deflection also computes internal shear and bending stress along the cross section and along the beam.

2D FRAME AND TRUSS EDITOR

The 2D editor is seamlessly integrated with the beam editor.  Draw arbitrary frame and truss structures and apply loads and constraints using the same simple interface as for beams.  You can visualize results directly within the 2D editor, or you can select a beam and get additional insights. 

INTERNAL STRESSES

Obtain internal bending and shear stress diagrams in addition to shear, bending, and deflection diagrams.  The internal stresses can be visualized along the length of the beam as well as along the vertical axis of the cross section using the beam editor.

CROSS SECTION EDITOR

Edit built-in cross sections.  Moment of inertia and area values are automatically calculated and applied to the rest of the beam calculations.

MORE FEATURES

‚Ä¢ The built-in database contains more data for your reference and convenience.
‚Ä¢ Apply beam self-weight optionally
‚Ä¢ Unlimited design files

  Tale of Immortal is an open-world sandbox based on Chinese mythology and cultivation. You will grow to become immortal, conquer the beasts from the Classic of Mountains and Season, make your choices carefully and grasp your own destiny.
„ÄêAscend to the Top with Immortal Cultivation A Journey of a Lifetime„Äë
Step into the enchanting world of the Tale of Immortal, where cultivation is an art that requires more than just financial means and help from fellow cultivators. To truly master it, one must possess a deep understanding of the craft and have access to the right cultivation venues. But that's not all‚Äîthe journey is fraught with danger, as you'll face unpredictable monsters, crisis-ridden mystic realms, insurmountable barriers, and brilliant treasures waiting to be discovered.
„ÄêNPCs with a Life of Their Own AI-Driven Interactive Ecology„Äë
Embrace a fully-realized NPC world, where each character is a unique entity with their own friends, family, and life trajectory‚Äî completely independent of your progress. However, if you choose to meddle, you certainly can!
„ÄêSurprising Encounters Await Experience a Fascinating Story„Äë
Are you ready to embark on a thrilling adventure? One where you might become the hero who saves the day and wins the heart of the love of your life? Or maybe you're looking to stir up some jealousy in your crush and have them fight for your affection? How about fulfilling a fifty-year-old promise or getting caught up in the struggle of a mysterious organization? Perhaps you'll uncover a long-forgotten treasure, only to have it snatched away by a cunning adversary?

„ÄêMartial Arts, Monsters, and Immortals Building Your Unique School„Äë
To embark on an epic adventure, you need to hone your skills and become a true warrior.

Start by building a solid foundation of cultivation. Your mind skills are crucial to success, so focus on cultivating a powerful mindset. From there, you can delve into martial and spiritual skills to take your abilities to the next level. As you explore, keep an eye out for opportunities to create edges with your motion and special skills. And don't forget to tap into your ultimate skills to save the day when necessary.
