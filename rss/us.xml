  Play local music or stream from a file/media server with LMP. 

Apple TV version included, with support for Emby, Navidrome, Plex, and Jellyfin.

‚ñ£ Import via iTunes or folder and play local tracks

LMP was designed from scratch with offline music in mind. You can store music on your device in two forms: iTunes music or audio file. The first would require syncing with iTunes on Windows or Finder on Mac. To import as audio files, simply transfer them to the LMP Music folder on your device via any means. If you choose the latter, you will be able to enjoy additional features, such as editing of metadata via the LMP browser assistant.

‚ñ£ Connect to a cloud server and stream music from the server

If you have insufficient storage on your device, you can also store your tracks on a server and stream from the server. File servers using SMB and WebDAV are supported. However, we recommend hosting a media server instead, via Plex, Emby, Navidrome or Subsonic due to faster import speeds. All tracks come together seamlessly, no matter how they are imported, providing a unified experience. You can enable the option in the settings to hide repeated tracks across servers.

‚ñ£ Manage playlists with ease

LMP has its own playlist system that allows you to not only add tracks from all sources, but also artists. All tracks belonging to the artist would automatically be added to the playlist everytime you open the app or rescan, even newly added ones. With flexible artist splitting, you will be able to ensure that tracks get allocated to the right artist.

When the AI playlist is enabled, LMP will also be able to generate a playlist for you based on your listening preferences. Usage data is only recorded if this feature is enabled, and all data recorded for this is stored locally, so you do not have to worry about data privacy.

‚ñ£ Supports CarPlay & Siri

With support for CarPlay, you can start playing a playlist or control what's playing from your car's CarPlay console. Alternatively, you can also tell Siri to start playing a track or all tracks belonging to a particular artist, or use it to control the playback state of the current track.

‚ñ£ Support LRC lyrics

LMP supports both embedded lyrics and .lrc files. Use the LRC or Enhanced LRC format, and the app will be able to autoscroll lyrics as the music plays. If you do not have time to add your own lyrics, you can specify the lyrics API to use, and the app will attempt to fetch lyrics of any track that is playing.

‚ñ£ Browser Assistant

Manage local files on the app using the LMP browser assistant, which you can open on your computer's browser. Import new files or move/delete existing files using the Folders tool, edit music metadata using the Metadata tool or even manage your playlists using the playlists tool.

  "If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you." - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK

"This War of Mine isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúfun,‚Äù but it‚Äôs definitely a game worth playing." , 9/10, 148apps

"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad" , Game Informer

In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. 

The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. 

Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.

This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition
It's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same ‚Äì how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? 

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Inspired by real-life events 
‚Ä¢ Control your survivors and manage your shelter 
‚Ä¢ Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves ‚Äì anything that helps you survive 
‚Ä¢ Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience 
‚Ä¢ Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game 
‚Ä¢ Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme

This War of Mine experience is now broadened with "The Little Ones" expansion. "The Little Ones" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective‚Äïthat of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.

‚Ä¢ Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine
‚Ä¢ Protect innocent children
‚Ä¢ Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need

  AudioTools from Studio Six Digital is a suite of professional-grade audio and acoustic analysis apps. Included in the price of this app is a great collection of professional tools -- SPL, RTA, FFT, Speaker Polarity Test, Generator, Audio Scope, CLF Viewer, and Recorder, and the framework to add more powerful modules as you need them.

Customize AudioTools for your needs by buying any of the additional optional modules, like Smaart Tools I, SPL Graph, or Impulse Response, at any time right from your iOS device.

We test every iOS device and calibrate the microphone level and frequency response for the best results. We have the ability to turn off the Apple low frequency filters, and on many devices we can measure up to 120 dB SPL.

Add iTestMic, iPrecisionMic, or iAudioInterface2 for a complete professional audio and acoustic test and measurement platform.

  Deflection is a powerful, versatile calculator for beams, 2D trusses, and 2D frames.  The interface is simple and intuitive, and the graphical output is state-of-the-art.  In addition to reaction, shear, bending moment, and deflection results, Deflection also computes internal shear and bending stress along the cross section and along the beam.

2D FRAME AND TRUSS EDITOR

The 2D editor is seamlessly integrated with the beam editor.  Draw arbitrary frame and truss structures and apply loads and constraints using the same simple interface as for beams.  You can visualize results directly within the 2D editor, or you can select a beam and get additional insights. 

INTERNAL STRESSES

Obtain internal bending and shear stress diagrams in addition to shear, bending, and deflection diagrams.  The internal stresses can be visualized along the length of the beam as well as along the vertical axis of the cross section using the beam editor.

CROSS SECTION EDITOR

Edit built-in cross sections.  Moment of inertia and area values are automatically calculated and applied to the rest of the beam calculations.

MORE FEATURES

‚Ä¢ The built-in database contains more data for your reference and convenience.
‚Ä¢ Apply beam self-weight optionally
‚Ä¢ Unlimited design files
‚Ä¢ Quick-start templates

  Tale of Immortal is an open-world sandbox based on Chinese mythology and cultivation. You will grow to become immortal, conquer the beasts from the Classic of Mountains and Season, make your choices carefully and grasp your own destiny.
„ÄêAscend to the Top with Immortal Cultivation A Journey of a Lifetime„Äë
Step into the enchanting world of the Tale of Immortal, where cultivation is an art that requires more than just financial means and help from fellow cultivators. To truly master it, one must possess a deep understanding of the craft and have access to the right cultivation venues. But that's not all‚Äîthe journey is fraught with danger, as you'll face unpredictable monsters, crisis-ridden mystic realms, insurmountable barriers, and brilliant treasures waiting to be discovered.
„ÄêNPCs with a Life of Their Own AI-Driven Interactive Ecology„Äë
Embrace a fully-realized NPC world, where each character is a unique entity with their own friends, family, and life trajectory‚Äî completely independent of your progress. However, if you choose to meddle, you certainly can!
„ÄêSurprising Encounters Await Experience a Fascinating Story„Äë
Are you ready to embark on a thrilling adventure? One where you might become the hero who saves the day and wins the heart of the love of your life? Or maybe you're looking to stir up some jealousy in your crush and have them fight for your affection? How about fulfilling a fifty-year-old promise or getting caught up in the struggle of a mysterious organization? Perhaps you'll uncover a long-forgotten treasure, only to have it snatched away by a cunning adversary?
„ÄêFrom Conquering the Territories to Uniting the World Building the Strongest Sect„Äë
Do you want to take your sect to new heights of power and glory? We've got the ultimate sect management gameplay that lets you experience the full range of sect life: from humble disciple to mighty sect master. Join a massive sect and work your way up from the bottom, or take on the challenge of leading a fallen sect back to prominence.
„ÄêMartial Arts, Monsters, and Immortals Building Your Unique School„Äë
To embark on an epic adventure, you need to hone your skills and become a true warrior.

Start by building a solid foundation of cultivation. Your mind skills are crucial to success, so focus on cultivating a powerful mindset. From there, you can delve into martial and spiritual skills to take your abilities to the next level. As you explore, keep an eye out for opportunities to create edges with your motion and special skills. And don't forget to tap into your ultimate skills to save the day when necessary.
„ÄêThe Triad of Power Artifact, Alchemy, and Talismans„Äë
Sharpen your skills and harness the power of tools!

At the start, you get to choose from three formidable weapons, each offering a distinct cultivation system. The Bagua Jade grants you the ability to revive yourself and your chosen ally, the Eye of Providence allows you to steal Beast Skills and gain unparalleled insights into the world, and the Mythical Gourd empowers you to capture a Boss and enlist it as your loyal sidekick: command it to fight by your side or to search for treasure on your behalf.

  ‚ÄúTrials of Mana,‚Äù the hit console game with over 1 million copies and downloads sold worldwide...is coming to a smartphone near you!

Fun for longtime fans of the Mana Series and new players alike!

‚óÜStory
When the world was shrouded in darkness, the Goddess of Mana drew forth the Sword of Mana to smite the eight Benevodons, monsters of destruction. She sealed the horrors inside the eight Mana Stones, bringing the realm back from the brink.

Weak from rebuilding the world, the Goddess changed into a tree and fell fast asleep for years. However, the forces of evil sought to free the Benevodons to gain control of the world. They started a terrible war to further their plot and destabilize the kingdoms.
Peace was at an end.

Mana itself began to disappear from the world and the Mana Tree to wither...

‚óÜPlayable Characters
Players start their adventure by selecting three of the six main characters. The overlapping story of interwoven destinies changes depending on who you choose as your main character and companions!

‚óÜGraphics

‚óÜBattle System

Switch to light or dark classes to strengthen your characters and change their look. In this remake, there‚Äôs also a newly added Class 4. With over 300 different kinds of abilities available, there are many different ways to train and power up your characters.

‚óÜDifficulty
You have the option of four difficulty settings: Beginner, Easy, Normal, and Hard. The Beginner setting allows players to resume in the same spot no matter how many times they get a game over. If you find action games hard or want to focus on the story, select this difficulty.

‚óÜSoundtrack
The 60-song soundtrack features arrangements overseen by the original composer, Hiroki Kikuta. Players can switch the BGM to the new version or the SNES version.

‚óÜVoiceover
Full voiceover in English and Japanese! The characters in your party determine which extra conversations happen during your journey.

‚óÜNew Game Plus
After you beat the game once, you will unlock new storylines for your party members. You can unlock harder difficulties like Expert and the No Future after playing through the new storylines.

‚óÜNew Features
Included in the game is the option to play through flashbacks for each character in your party. You‚Äôll also see a familiar Mana Series face when searching for Li‚Äôl Cactus during your adventures. Plus, there are additions like a new type of item seed and the autosave feature.

A New Chapter in the Night Chasers' History
A long time ago, there was a mercenary group known as the Night Chasers. Instead of making money, these heroic warriors went around helping those in need. During the war, they helped a great many people who were suffering under tyranny and injustice. However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband. Years later, four young people - Zack, Lucien, Sid, and Odelia - decided to carry on their legacy, forming the new Night Chasers.

One day, Zack and his party save an Elven girl named Dolores. Suffering from amnesia, Dolores cannot remember why she has ventured so far from the Elven Kingdom ‚Äì only that she has been sent on an urgent quest. Concerned for her well-being, the Night Chasers take her into their fold, leading them to discover an ancient and terrible threat to the kingdom...

</ul><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  Play the digital adaptation of the beloved tabletop board game. Root is a game of adventure and war where 2 to 4 players battle for control of a vast wilderness.

The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance‚Äôs hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.

Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.

The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.

</p><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  We fused card games and roguelikes together to make the best single player deckbuilder we could. Craft a unique deck, encounter bizarre creatures, discover relics of immense power, and Slay the Spire!

Features:

- Dynamic Deck Building: Choose your cards wisely! Discover hundreds of cards to add to your deck with each attempt at climbing the Spire. Select cards that work together to efficiently dispatch foes and reach the top
- An Ever-changing Spire: Whenever you embark on a journey up the Spire, the layout differs each time. Choose a risky or safe path, face different enemies, choose different cards, discover different relics, and even fight different bosses!
- Powerful Relics to Discover: Powerful items known as relics can be found throughout the Spire. The effects of these relics can greatly enhance your deck through powerful interactions. But beware, obtaining a relic may cost you more than just gold‚Ä¶
