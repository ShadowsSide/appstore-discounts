  In this exciting mobile game, you will become a legendary agent and embark on a secret operation codenamed "zero". Your mission is to sneak into the enemy's aircraft base and destroy all enemy aircraft. You will face many threats alone, but fortunately, you have a support aircraft to provide you with airdrop supplies.

The gameplay of the game is simple but challenging. You will control the agent to move left and right on the runway of the aircraft base to avoid the attacks of enemy aircraft and the falling missiles. The top of the screen is the flight area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãthe enemy aircraft, and they will continue to fire missiles at you in an attempt to shoot you down. You need to stay alert at all times to avoid these deadly threats.

By clicking on the screen, you can fire into the sky and destroy enemy aircraft. There is also a "continuous shooting mode" in the game. After turning it on, you can continue to fire into the air and eliminate the enemy more efficiently. But be careful, once the enemy's missiles fall to the ground, they will cause great damage to you. You only have 3 chances to be hit. Once this number is exceeded, the game will end.

During the battle, the support aircraft will regularly drop airdrops for you. These airdrops contain a variety of useful props, such as ammunition boxes for replenishing bullets, medical kits for restoring health, and upgrade props for strengthening missiles. Proper use of these airdrop props will help you gain an advantage in battle.

As the game progresses, as long as you can hold on longer, you will get additional upgrade opportunities. Every upgrade will make you stronger, whether it is improving firepower, increasing health, or unlocking more powerful props, which can make you more confident when facing the enemy. The longer you hold on, the greater the benefits you will get. The ultimate goal is to defend yourself for as long as possible and destroy more enemy aircraft.

This is a mini casual game that can start an exciting agent journey anytime, anywhere. Simple and easy-to-use operations, coupled with challenging gameplay, allow you to experience the thrill of exciting battles in fragmented time.

‚Ä¢ Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.

‚Ä¢ Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.

‚Ä¢ Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.

‚Ä¢ Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.

‚Ä¢ Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.

‚Ä¢ Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)

‚Ä¢ Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.

‚Ä¢ On 3.5 " displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.

‚Ä¢ Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.

I'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help. This app is constantly reviewed and improved because it is my tool, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me by email at davidquiles@me.com

Thank you!

  In this exciting mobile game, you will become a legendary agent and embark on a secret operation codenamed "zero". Your mission is to sneak into the enemy's aircraft base and destroy all enemy aircraft. You will face many threats alone, but fortunately, you have a support aircraft to provide you with airdrop supplies.

The gameplay of the game is simple but challenging. You will control the agent to move left and right on the runway of the aircraft base to avoid the attacks of enemy aircraft and the falling missiles. The top of the screen is the flight area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãthe enemy aircraft, and they will continue to fire missiles at you in an attempt to shoot you down. You need to stay alert at all times to avoid these deadly threats.

By clicking on the screen, you can fire into the sky and destroy enemy aircraft. There is also a "continuous shooting mode" in the game. After turning it on, you can continue to fire into the air and eliminate the enemy more efficiently. But be careful, once the enemy's missiles fall to the ground, they will cause great damage to you. You only have 3 chances to be hit. Once this number is exceeded, the game will end.

During the battle, the support aircraft will regularly drop airdrops for you. These airdrops contain a variety of useful props, such as ammunition boxes for replenishing bullets, medical kits for restoring health, and upgrade props for strengthening missiles. Proper use of these airdrop props will help you gain an advantage in battle.

As the game progresses, as long as you can hold on longer, you will get additional upgrade opportunities. Every upgrade will make you stronger, whether it is improving firepower, increasing health, or unlocking more powerful props, which can make you more confident when facing the enemy. The longer you hold on, the greater the benefits you will get. The ultimate goal is to defend yourself for as long as possible and destroy more enemy aircraft.

This is a mini casual game that can start an exciting agent journey anytime, anywhere. Simple and easy-to-use operations, coupled with challenging gameplay, allow you to experience the thrill of exciting battles in fragmented time.

  You will become a brave guardian and embark on an adventure to a shrine surrounded by monsters to help the Onmyoji dispel evil and liberate the trapped monster girl.

The game adopts the classic horizontal version of the game. The character you control holds a weapon and stands in the center of the screen, advancing through the various scenes of the shrine as you operate. The road ahead is full of monsters that are malicious to you. They are lurking in the shadows or flying in the air, ready to attack you at any time. You need to keep firing bullets to repel these monsters and protect your way forward.

In the process of moving forward, you can collect gold coins and various props floating in the air by controlling the character to jump upwards. Gold coins are an important resource in the game, which can be used to unlock more powerful weapons and upgrade your equipment. Props can provide you with immediate help, such as increasing the number of bullets, increasing the power of weapons, and obtaining a short invincible state. Reasonable use of these props will make you more calm when facing powerful monsters.

As you continue to defeat monsters, the distance you travel will become longer and longer, and every corner of the shrine will be gradually liberated by you. Each level has a different scene setting, from the ancient shrine courtyard to the deep woods, to the mysterious basement, each scene has unique monsters and challenges waiting for you. You need to flexibly control the character, dodge the monster's attacks, and accurately fire bullets to eliminate the enemy.

  You will become a brave guardian and embark on an adventure to a shrine surrounded by monsters to help the Onmyoji dispel evil and liberate the trapped monster girl.

The game adopts the classic horizontal version of the game. The character you control holds a weapon and stands in the center of the screen, advancing through the various scenes of the shrine as you operate. The road ahead is full of monsters that are malicious to you. They are lurking in the shadows or flying in the air, ready to attack you at any time. You need to keep firing bullets to repel these monsters and protect your way forward.

In the process of moving forward, you can collect gold coins and various props floating in the air by controlling the character to jump upwards. Gold coins are an important resource in the game, which can be used to unlock more powerful weapons and upgrade your equipment. Props can provide you with immediate help, such as increasing the number of bullets, increasing the power of weapons, and obtaining a short invincible state. Reasonable use of these props will make you more calm when facing powerful monsters.

As you continue to defeat monsters, the distance you travel will become longer and longer, and every corner of the shrine will be gradually liberated by you. Each level has a different scene setting, from the ancient shrine courtyard to the deep woods, to the mysterious basement, each scene has unique monsters and challenges waiting for you. You need to flexibly control the character, dodge the monster's attacks, and accurately fire bullets to eliminate the enemy.
