   2. Modify  `global.d.ts` 
      * If the code you get is  `xxx `

If you don't want to participate in coding implementation, you can open an  `Issue`  if you have good ideas or find bugs<br />If you want to participate in coding implementation, due to the complexity of existing logic, rash changes may affect stored data. It's best to open an  `Issue`  first. Follow-up tasks can be assigned based on the affected modules or difficulty
